Hi!

The proposal you've committed to is over halfway to beta! To get it the rest of the way, we need more people to commit to using the site.

If you know anyone who might be interested, send them this link:
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/
 

Committing is the only way to get access to the private beta, and every committer moves the proposal one step closer to launching. Hurry! Once the private beta begins, new sign-ups will be closed until the site goes public.

All the best,

The Stack Exchange Team
